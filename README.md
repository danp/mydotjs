My scripts for use with [dotjs](https://github.com/defunkt/dotjs)

* `default.js`: add `target=_blank` to all links, which in Chrome
  means they'll open in new tabs. Requires dotjs >=1.3.
* `console.aws.amazon.com.js`: make pressing `u` click the refresh
  button. Sucky at the moment, doesn't ensure there is a button,
  also triggers while in inputs.
